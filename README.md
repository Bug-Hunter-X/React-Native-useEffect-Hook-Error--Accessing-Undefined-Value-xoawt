# React Native useEffect Hook Error: Accessing Undefined Value

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when using the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array `[]`.  The issue arises when attempting to access values that are not yet defined or are asynchronously updating within the `useEffect` callback.

## Problem

When the `useEffect` hook runs with `[]`, it's intended to run only once after the initial render. However, if you rely on values that are asynchronously fetched or not immediately available, those values might be `undefined` or `null` during the initial execution of the `useEffect` callback.  This leads to errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`.

## Solution

The solution involves properly handling the asynchronous operation and checking for `null` or `undefined` values before attempting to access their properties.  This ensures that the component gracefully handles the initial loading state and avoids errors.
